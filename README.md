Project Title: “Rise of the vegan: change in vegan restaurants in rural and urban areas .”

Hypothesis: The number of vegan restaurants in urban(150,000+ people)areas will be greater  than rural areas (less than 150,000 people)

Measurable Hypothesis: 
Alternative:  If the city population is larger than 150,000 (urban area) then the percentage of vegan restaurants will be higher than in cities with populations less than 150,000 (rural area).
Null: If the city population is larger than 150,000 (urban area) then the percentage of vegan restaurants will NOT be higher than in cities with populations less than 150,000 (rural area).

Data sets to be used: https://www.yelp.com/dataset and yelp tar file 
https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities/details

(population API)
Action Items:
1.	Pull data from GeoCities including population, time zone, region, city
2.	Create a random sampling of 100 urban and 100 rural areas
3.	Pull data from Yelp Fusion (all categories) using cities generated from sampling
4.	Extract data from Yelp Fusion (vegan) using full data pulled in step 3
5.	Calculate percentages
6.	Scatter plot (population vs. vegan restaurants)
Questions posed in the Data:
Restaurant average price ($$)
Insights on food types offering vegetarian/vegan foods
Average Star rating by year
Top menu orders from vegan/vegetarian restaurants by year (count and monetary) (2 Graphs)
Top Vegan/Vegetarian restaurants by state (Density Map) over time (2 Graphs)
Item popularity (2 Graphs)
-	Incorporation of Impossible/Beyond into menu
